1 Total population change includes a residual. This residual represents the change in population that cannot be attributed to any specific demographic component. See Population Estimates Terms and Definitions at http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/about/glossary.html.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 Net international migration for the United States includes the international migration of both native and foreign-born populations.  Specifically, it includes: (a) the net international migration of the foreign born, (b) the net migration between the United States and Puerto Rico, (c) the net migration of natives to and from the United States, and (d) the net movement of the Armed Forces population between the United States and overseas.  Net international migration for Puerto Rico includes the migration of native and foreign-born populations between the United States and Puerto Rico.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note: The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010 population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions. All geographic boundaries for the 2019 population estimates are as of January 1, 2019. For population estimates methodology statements, see http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology.html.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note: The 6,222 people in Bedford city, Virginia, which was an independent city as of the 2010 Census, are not included in the April 1, 2010 Census enumerated population presented in the county estimates. In July 2013, the legal status of Bedford changed from a city to a town and it became dependent within (or part of) Bedford County, Virginia. This population of Bedford town is now included in the April 1, 2010 estimates base and all July 1 estimates for Bedford County. Because it is no longer an independent city, Bedford town is not listed in this table. As a result, the sum of the April 1, 2010 census values for Virginia counties and independent cities does not equal the 2010 Census count for Virginia, and the sum of April 1, 2010 census values for all counties and independent cities in the United States does not equal the 2010 Census count for the United States. Substantial geographic changes to counties can be found on the Census Bureau website at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/county-changes.html.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
